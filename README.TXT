PROJECT TITLE:Laser Maze 

VERSION or DATE:4/18/18

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: RIght click on LaserMaze class and select the void main(String args[]) method and click ok

AUTHORS: Justyn McHarg, Collin Adams, Devante Saenger, Dylan Lane, Ashley Hughes

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME/DESCRIPTION: There are 11 game tokens, 1 laser token(red), 5 Target/Mirror tokens(purple), 2 Beam Splitter tokens(green),
1 Double Mirror token(blue), 1 Checkpoint token(yellow) and 1 Cell Blocker token(black). Your goal is to complete a path from the 
laser beam to the target(s). Use all the pieces on the grid and the pieces that are listed at the top of the board 
when trying to find the solution. If all pieces are not used you will get an incorrect solution message. 
Most pieces will already be placed on the board for you and those pieces you cannot move. Depending on which board you choose 
to play you will be able to rotate certain pieces. The pieces that are initially shown with question marks need to have their
orientation selected to find the final solution. The number in the upper right hand corner shows you how many targets
you need to hit to find the correct solution. Once you think you have the correct placement and orientation of pieces 
hit the fire button to test your solution.

FUNTIONS OF EACH PIECE: The RED LASER provides the laser beam, once you think you have the correct solution you can press the 
fire laser button and check to see if your solution is correct.
The TARGET/MIRROR can be used for your targets, as a mirror or both. The mirror side reflects the beam 90 degrees.
The DOUBLE MIRROR has mirrors on both sidses that reflect the beam 90 degrees.
The BEAM SPLITTER splits the beam in two paths. One path reflects at 90 degrees and the other passes straight through the piece
The CHECKPOINT Serves as a piece that the beam MUST pass through
The CELL BLOCKER prevents you from placing pieces in the cell which it inhabits. The laser beam CAN pass over it.
